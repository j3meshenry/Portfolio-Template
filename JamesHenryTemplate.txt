I could not find any good templates to use when making my website, but every Engineering student needs one. 
That's why I took the time to make my own. You can modify the colors, images, or anything you want. 
Have fun :)

1) Make a folder anywhere on your laptop, this is where you'll put your code
2) Download my code, or copy and paste it into step 4
3) Open VSCode, go to file > Open Folder > and open the folder you created 
4) Create two files: index.html, styles.css (copy and paste my code in this repo)
5) I added comments about where you should modify the code.
6) If you have questions, comment on my linkedin, email me, or ask ai.

I hope this template is good for you to make your portfolio.
